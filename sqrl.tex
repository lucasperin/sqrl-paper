\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	In this paper we give a full description of the SQRL authentication
	protocol and an analysys of known vulnerabilities. We run an 
	experiment for formal verification of the protocul using ProVerif.
	Furthermore, we analyse a modified version of SQRL proposed to fix
	this vulnerability.

\section{Intoduction}
	Authentication protocols play an important role in modern internet
	usability. Most social network providers already have implemented
	some sort of authentication method to make it easy for users to connect
	to different services using the same account and credentials. Facebook \todo{Mencionar Oauth2, etc?}
	and google are fine examples of this. However, we know that the good and 
	old password is no longer reliable and has poor usability. \todo{Referencias}
	Furthermore, most services on the web still use pass phrases for authentication,
	since this has been the main method used in previous decades. Hence,
	a common aproach to provide more security to personal accounts has 
	been the two-step verification, using and One Time Passwords (OTP) 
	provided by a trusted mobile app or token. This	method has gained some 
	space in authentication providers such as the
	ones previously mentioned. Therefore, we now have a mixed authentication process
	where the user can still use his passwords and be prompted for an
	OTP optionally.
